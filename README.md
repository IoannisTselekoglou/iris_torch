## Introduction

This Python project implements Linear Regression algorithms from scratch. The primary goal is to offer a clear and comprehensible implementation of these fundamental machine learning algorithms. It serves as a valuable resource for educational purposes or as a launching point for further research.

## Explanation

### Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm designed for predicting continuous target values based on input features. Its objective is to identify the best-fit straight line that minimizes the sum of squared errors between predicted and actual values.

## Examples

To illustrate the usage of the implemented algorithms, we provide the following examples:

- [example1.py](examples/example1.py): Demonstrates Linear Regression applied to a synthetic dataset.

Feel free to explore and run these examples to gain insights into how the algorithms perform under different scenarios.

## Testing

Unit tests are crucial for ensuring the correctness of our implementations. We have included comprehensive test suites for both the Linear Regression and Gradient Descent algorithms.

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
$ python -m unittest discover tests
