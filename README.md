## Introduction

Welcome to Iriis Torch, a Python project that leverages PyTorch for iris flower classification. This project includes a dataset, a model for iris flower classification and a Jupyter notebook for analysis and visualization.

## Data set

The dataset for this project contains information about iris flowers. It includes features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the corresponding labels indicating the species of the iris flower.


## Model 
We use a very simple Neuralnetwork. 


## Example 

The iris_notebook.ipynb Jupyter notebook is a comprehensive document that walks through the entire process of loading data, training the model, and evaluating its performance. It also includes visualizations and analysis of the results to provide insights into the iris flower classification task.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download Dataset.
3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
    ```bash
    - pip install matplotlib
